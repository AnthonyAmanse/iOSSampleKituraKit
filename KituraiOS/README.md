# Kitura 2 App Component

### Usage

This directory of the repo was created to store and demonstrate that the server component can work with an iOS application. It uses a new Kitura client side library called **KituraBuddy**. If you were to create a server plus client project, placing it here in its own folder will help keep everything organised.
