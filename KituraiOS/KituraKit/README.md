# How to Import KituraKit into an iOS Project

### File Structure

This folder contains the Swift code from [KituraKit](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/KituraBuddy) and the code for its dependencies to make a single module for importing into an iOS project. Swift Package Manager is not currently supported in iOS, these instructions provide a workaround so you can easily use KituraKit in iOS.

#### KituraKit

Client.swift and RequestErrorExtension.swift are taken from the sources files folder of the [KituraKit](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/KituraBuddy) repository with their import statements removed.

#### KituraKit dependencies

KituraKit depends on the following four modules:

[CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CircuitBreaker), [LoggerAPI](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/LoggerAPI), [KituraContracts](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SafetyContracts), [SwiftyRequest](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SwiftyRequest)

Their source folders (with imports removed) have been added inside this KituraKit folder. This allows KituraKit to use them without needing additional imports.

### Importing KituraKit to an Xcode Project

1. Download KituraKit For iOS import from [KituraKit releases](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/KituraBuddy/releases). This should be a zipped binary file containing KituraKit, It's dependencies and this readme.

2. Extract the files from the Zip folder.

3. Drag the "KituraKit" folder from the finder into your Xcode project just below your xCode Project file.

4. A menu stating "Choose options for adding these files" should appear. Tick "copy items if needed", select "Create groups" and in add to target make sure your app is ticked.
